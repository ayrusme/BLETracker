# BLETracker
BLETracker is a project to create an indoor tracking system. The tool will enable people to track and locate people in a near real-time manner. The future applications of this project might implement an automatic attendance system.

You'll need an Arduino board and an NRF24L01 module for the Beacons. 
The overall architecture is like
